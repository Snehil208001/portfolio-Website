    description: `üì± SwipeRightly App ‚Äì Real-Time Dating App with Firebase & Jetpack Compose
SwipeRightly is a fully functional dating app designed to demonstrate a modern Android development workflow using Jetpack Compose, MVVM architecture, and Firebase for real-time features. It offers an intuitive swiping experience, secure user authentication, and live chat‚Äîall backed by a scalable cloud infrastructure.

üß† Architecture & Tech Stack
Built on the MVVM pattern, the app separates UI, logic, and data layers cleanly:

View (UI Layer): Built entirely with Jetpack Compose, screens like SwipeScreen.kt and LoginScreen.kt observe state from the ViewModel and update reactively.

ViewModel (SWViewModel.kt): Manages user actions (login, signup, swipes), fetches data from Firebase, and updates UI states using mutableStateOf.

Model (Data Layer): Uses Kotlin data classes (UserData, ChatData) and Firebase services (Firestore, Auth, Storage) for backend logic and storage.

üîê Authentication Flow
The app uses Firebase Authentication to manage sign-ups and logins:

On signup, the app verifies unique usernames before creating an account and storing profile data in Firestore.

On login, credentials are validated, and the user is navigated to the swipe screen.

‚ù§Ô∏è Swiping Experience
The core feature is a responsive, physics-based card swiping interface:

Cards are rendered using ProfileCard composables.

A custom SwipeableCard modifier handles gestures, rotation, and direction.

Upon a right swipe, the app checks for reciprocal matches:

If matched, a chat document is created and a match popup is shown.

If not, the swipe is logged for future reference.

üí¨ Real-Time Chat
When users match, they can chat instantly:

Chat uses a snapshot listener on Firestore to enable real-time updates.

Messages are sent and stored in a nested Firestore collection under a shared chatId.`,
